### The Map

**Markers:** 
The first feature on the world map is the markers. We have used the markers to notate each of the 32 teams that played Qatar Football World Cup 2022. The longitude and latitude has been added to the file so that you can see the location of each team on the complete map. Once you click on a marker, you will see the team and their ranking. For this we utilized Leaflet JS.
