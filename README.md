### The Map

**Markers:** 
One feature on the world map is the markers. We notated each of the 32 teams with a marker. The longitude and latitude for each location was entered to show teams on the world map. Once you click on a marker, you will see the team and their ranking. For this we utilized Leaflet JS. 

**Pie Chart:**
If you choose to check the affiliations, that is an option. Plotly is used to show the club or affiliation of each team. There are a total of 6 clubs that are included within the 32 teams playing for the World Cup in Qatar. We want to indicate which club has the largest percentage that are playing in the World Cup and felt this would be the best to display this.

**Bar Chart:**
Lastly, you can see the details for the previous World Cups in a glance. This bar chart will allow you to compare the average attendance over the years. As you review this chart, you will be able to see an average of how it has grown over from 1930 - 2022, excluding the WWII
